                       You look at him with a puzzled face. Wondering why he yelled over one question. &quot;I just wanted to know since you've been gone for almost a year. 
                       &quot; &quot;Ya well, don't worry about it.&quot; Dead silence filled the car. You focus on driving to not think about what just happened.
