# GroupProject
This project is Ignorance Is Bliss, an interactive story application. Its purpose is to provide simple fun to those who chose to use it.
It moves from page to page using a series of buttons which provide simple decisions to be made and navigates through
a storyline that changes depending on the choices you make. 

Prerequisites:
To install this app you would need a phone running the latest version of its operating system.

Installation:
Assuming it is ever published, it would be available likely on the google play store for download.

Usage:
To use Ignorance Is Bliss, simply follow the simple prompts given by the story to determine what outcome you wish to explore. If you do
not like where you end up, start over and work your way through a new way. The possibilities aren't endless, but there will be additional
content to come!
